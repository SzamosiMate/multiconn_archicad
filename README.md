## Features

- **Multi-connection Support**: Connect to one, multiple, or all open instances of Archicad.
- **Seamless Integration**: Utilizes Archicad's official Python package.
- **Tapir Add-On Integration**: Run commands using the Tapir Archicad Add-On framework
- **Efficient I/O Operations**: Handles connection management using concurrent or asynchronous code.
- **Project Management**: Find and open Archicad projects programmatically.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of the package from the following link using `pip`:

```bash
pip install https://github.com/SzamosiMate/multiconn_archicad/releases/download/v0.3.3/multiconn_archicad-0.3.3-py3-none-any.whl
```

**Prerequisites: Tapir Add-On is Required**

This package **critically depends** on the [Tapir Archicad Add-On](https://github.com/ENZYME-APD/tapir-archicad-automation?tab=readme-ov-file). You **must** install the Tapir Add-On in your Archicad application for full functionality.

**Specifically, the Tapir Add-On is required for:**
*   All commands executed via the `core.post_tapir_command()` method.
*   Internal commands used by `multiconn_archicad` to identify running Archicad instances and projects (`GetProjectInfo`, `GetArchicadLocation`).

**Without the Tapir Add-On installed, key functionalities like discovering Archicad instances, identifying projects, and running any Tapir-specific commands will fail.** Please install the latest version of Tapir before using this package.

## Usage

⚠️**Disclaimer:** MultiConn ArchiCAD is functional, stable in practice, and ready for use — it has been successfully used in several recent projects. That said, the library is still under active development: its interfaces may evolve in future releases, and it hasn’t yet undergone extensive formal testing. It’s well-suited for quick scripts and one-off automation tasks. If you’re building something long-term or mission-critical, we recommend pinning the version you’re using and keeping an eye on future updates.

### Actions - managing the connection
Actions allow you to manage the state of the connection object. You can connect to or disconnect from Archicad instances, quit instances, or refresh ports. All actions can have multiple types of inputs. For each type of input you have to call the corresponding method of the action. To connect to all available ArchiCAD instances, you have to call the .all() method on .connect ( e.g. `conn.connect.all()`). The aim of this method is to provide better autocompletion.

#### Example: Connection Management
```python 
from multiconn_archicad import MultiConn, Port

conn = MultiConn()

# connect all ArchiCAD instances that were running at instantiation / the last refresh
conn.connect.all()

# disconnect from the instance at port 19723   
conn.disconnect.from_ports(Port(19723))

# refresh all closed ports - ports with no running archicad instance   
conn.refresh.closed_ports()

# close, and remove from the dict of open port headers the archicad instance specified by ConnHeader
conn.quit.from_headers(conn.open_port_headers[Port(19735)])
```

### Project Management

The MultiConn object provides actions to find and open ArchiCAD projects programmatically.

#### Finding ArchiCAD Instances

You can use the `find_archicad` action to locate a specific ArchiCAD instance from a `ConnHeader`.

```python
from multiconn_archicad import MultiConn, ConnHeader

conn = MultiConn()
conn_header = ConnHeader(Port(19723))

# Find the port for a specific connection header
port = conn.find_archicad.from_header(conn_header)
if port:
    print(f"Found ArchiCAD instance at port: {port}")
```

#### Opening Projects

The `open_project` action allows you to programmatically open ArchiCAD projects.

```python
from multiconn_archicad import MultiConn, ConnHeader, TeamworkCredentials

conn = MultiConn()

# Open a project using a connection header
conn_header = ConnHeader.from_dict(saved_header_data)
port = conn.open_project.from_header(conn_header)
# Optionally, open in demo mode:
port = conn.open_project.from_header(conn_header, demo=True) 

# For teamwork projects, you can provide credentials
credentials = TeamworkCredentials("username", "password")
port = conn.open_project.with_teamwork_credentials(conn_header, credentials)
```

#### Switching Projects (Solo Only)

The `switch_project` action allows you to open a *different* solo project (`.pln`) within an *already running* Archicad instance, without needing to quit and restart. This is useful for quickly changing between solo project files managed by the same Archicad process.
 
```python
from multiconn_archicad import MultiConn, ConnHeader, Port

conn = MultiConn()
# Assume Archicad is running on port 19723 and port 19725

# Get the header for the project you want to switch *to* (e.g., loaded from a file)
target_header = ConnHeader.from_dict(saved_header_data_for_another_project)

# Specify the port of the *running instance* you want to load the new project into
running_instance_port = Port(19723)

# Switch the project on the running instance
# This will close the current project on port 19723 and open the one defined by target_header
new_header_state = conn.switch_project.from_header(original_port=running_instance_port, new_header=target_header)

# Alternatively, switch using a file path directly
new_path = "C:/path/to/another/project.pln"
new_header_state_from_path = conn.switch_project.from_path(original_port=running_instance_port, new_path=new_path)
```

### Dialog Handling

MultiConn can automatically handle most dialog windows that appear when opening ArchiCAD projects. This is particularly useful for batch operations and automation scripts.

```python
from multiconn_archicad import MultiConn, WinDialogHandler, win_int_handler_factory

# Create a MultiConn instance with a dialog handler
conn = MultiConn(dialog_handler=WinDialogHandler(win_int_handler_factory))

# Dialog windows will be automatically handled when opening projects
conn.open_project.from_header(conn_header)
```

The current implementation includes:
- `EmptyDialogHandler`: Does nothing (default)
- `WinDialogHandler`: Waits for ArchiCAD to start, and monitors appearing dialogs. If dialog appears, searches for appropriate handler in win_int_handler factory. Only works on windows.
- `win_int_handler_factory`: Provides dialog handleing logic on a dialog by dialog basis for the INT language version. It is an example you should customize for your specific project needs. Even if you end up not modifying it, you should definitely know what it does for what dialog.

### Serialization

The MultiConn package allows you to save and load connection configurations, making it easier to work with specific projects across multiple sessions.

#### Saving Connection Headers

```python
from multiconn_archicad import MultiConn, Port

conn = MultiConn()
conn.connect.all()

# Get a connection header
conn_header = conn.open_port_headers[Port(19723)]

# Convert to dictionary for serialization
header_dict = conn_header.to_dict()

# Save to file using your preferred method
import json
with open('conn_header.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(header_dict, f)
```

#### Loading Connection Headers

```python
from multiconn_archicad import ConnHeader, TeamworkCredentials

# Load from file
import json
with open('conn_header.json', 'r') as f:
    header_dict = json.load(f)

# Create a header from the dictionary
conn_header = ConnHeader.from_dict(header_dict)

# For teamwork projects, you need to provide credentials
if isinstance(conn_header.archicad_id, TeamworkProjectID):
    credentials = TeamworkCredentials("username", "password")
    # Use the credentials when opening the project
    port = conn.open_project.with_teamwork_credentials(conn_header, credentials)
```

Note: Passwords are not stored in serialized connection headers for security reasons. You must provide them when loading teamwork projects.

### Running Commands

#### Single Archicad Instance

To run commands on one chosen ArchiCAD instance the `MultiConn` object has a connection called `primary`. Calling a command directly from the MultiConn object will send it to the `primary` instance. The `primary` connection can be changed by assigning any valid `Port`, or `ConnHeader` object to `MultiConn.primary`.

#### Example: Running Commands on a Single Archicad Instance
```python
from multiconn_archicad import MultiConn, Port

# After instantiation the primary connection will be the instance with the lowest port number (probably 19723)
conn = MultiConn()

# Set the primary connection to the instance running on port 19725
conn.primary = Port(19725)

# Prints project info from the instance on port 19725
print(conn.core.post_tapir_command("GetProjectInfo"))
```

#### Multiple Archicad Instances

The MultiConn object stores references to `ConnHeaders` for all open ports (ports, with a running ArchiCAD instance). The references are stored in a dictionary at `.open_port_headers`. This dictionary maps each port to its corresponding connection. Each `ConnHeader` object has its own command objects for each used command namespace. The MultiConn objects has properties to access 3 subsets of open ports based on the status of the `ConnHeaders`: 

- **`active`**: Successfully connected instances.
- **`failed`**: Instances where the connection attempt failed.
- **`pending`**: Instances with no connection attempt made or disconnected.

#### Example: Running Commands on Multiple Archicad Instances

```python
from multiconn_archicad import MultiConn

conn = MultiConn()
conn.connect.all()

# Explicit loop to gather elements from all active connections
elements = {}
for port, conn_header in conn.active.items():
    elements[port] = conn_header.standard.commands.GetAllElements()

# Using dictionary comprehension
elements = {
    port: conn_header.standard.commands.GetAllElements()
    for port, conn_header in conn.active.items()
}
```

### Namespaces

The aim of the module is to incorporate all solutions that let users automate ArchiCAD from python. The different solutions are separated into namespaces, accessed from properties of the connection object. One of the planned features is letting users supply a list of namespaces they want to use when creating the connections. At the moment there are only two namespaces:

*   **`standard`**: The official ArchiCAD python wrapper.
*   **`core`**: Provides simplified methods for interacting with the Archicad API: `core.post_command()` sends official JSON API commands, while `core.post_tapir_command()` sends commands specific to the Tapir Add-On.
    *   **Success Response:** Returns only the essential result data (e.g., the content of the `"result"` or `"addOnCommandResponse"` field).
    *   **Error Handling:** All errors (network, timeout, API failures, Tapir command issues) are now reported by **raising specific exceptions** (defined in `multiconn_archicad.errors`). Calls to `post_command` and `post_tapir_command` **must** be wrapped in `try...except` blocks.
    *   Inspired by Tapir's ["aclib"](https://github.com/ENZYME-APD/tapir-archicad-automation/tree/main/archicad-addon/Examples/aclib).

#### Example: Using two namespaces together
```python
def run(conn: MultiConn | ConnHeader) -> dict[str, Any]:
    elements = conn.standard.commands.GetAllElements()
    command_parameters = {
        "elements": [element.to_dict() for element in elements],
        "highlightedColors": [[50, 255, 100, 100] for _ in range(len(elements))],
        "wireframe3D": True,
        "nonHighlightedColor": [0, 0, 255, 128],
    }
    return conn.core.post_tapir_command('HighlightElements', command_parameters)
```

### Error Handling

**MultiConn Archicad** uses a structured exception hierarchy for reporting errors, particularly those originating from the `core` namespace API calls. This makes error handling more explicit and robust.

*   All library-specific exceptions inherit from `MulticonnArchicadError`.
*   **API Communication Errors:** Inherit from `APIErrorBase`.
    *   `RequestError`: Problems during the request itself (network, connection, timeout, invalid response).
        *   Examples: `APIConnectionError`, `CommandTimeoutError`, `InvalidResponseFormatError`.
    *   `ArchicadAPIError`: Errors reported *by* Archicad or the Tapir Add-On in the response body.
        *   Examples: `StandardAPIError` (from official API), `TapirCommandError` (from Tapir Add-On).
*   **Other Errors:** Include issues like `ProjectAlreadyOpenError`, `ProjectNotFoundError`, `NotFullyInitializedError`.

You **must** wrap calls to `core.post_command` and `core.post_tapir_command` in `try...except` blocks to handle these potential exceptions gracefully.

#### Example: Handling Core Command Exceptions

```python
from multiconn_archicad.errors import TapirCommandError, RequestError, ArchicadAPIError, APIErrorBase 

try:
    # Attempt to execute a Tapir command
    result = conn.core.post_tapir_command('YourTapirCommandName', command_parameters)
    print(f"Command successful! Result: {result}")

# Handle specific error reported by the Tapir Add-On
except TapirCommandError as e:
    print(f"Tapir command failed: Code={e.code}, Message='{e.message}'")

# Handle broader Archicad API errors (includes StandardAPIError)
except ArchicadAPIError as e:
    print(f"Archicad API error: Code={e.code}, Message='{e.message}'")

# Handle connection/request related errors (timeout, network issues, etc.)
except RequestError as e:
    print(f"Request failed: Message='{e.message}' (Code={e.code})")

# Catch any other potential API-related error (Catches all above errors as well.
# Only this shoud be used if you do not need to handle failiures differently
except APIErrorBase as e:
     print(f"An API error occurred: Code={e.code}, Message='{e.message}'")

```
